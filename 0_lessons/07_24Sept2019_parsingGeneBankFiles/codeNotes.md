#### get a simple GenBank file to convert into a fasta file.

- PubMed: nucleotide search(M55025.1)
- link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/M55025.1
- send to: GenBank file
- cover code: geneToFasta.py to conver genbank files to fasta format.
- code ref:  https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/python/genbank2fasta/

#### multiple records in genbank file to convert to fasta
PubMed: nucleotide search(cystic fibrosis)
- link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/M96936.1
- send to: GenBank file
- cover code: genbankToFastaAminoAcids.py to parse out translated cds regions (protein sequences) from GenBank files
- code ref:  https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/python/genbank2fasta/



#### analysis: Thursday?
