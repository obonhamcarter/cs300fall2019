andrewsz,Zachary Andrews,100,Nicely done,100,"Nicely done: Excellent insight from your reflection document. You are right, rewriting DNA from a species may not be a great idea especially when the new organism may disrupt the equilibrium in nature.",100,"Nicely done; You are correct, logical bugs can be only be found when you can approximate the output.",pending,pending
butlera,Alexander Butler,100,Nicely done,100,Nicely done; a good concern about altering animal genetics.,92,"Nicely done; You are correct, logical bugs can be only be found when you can approximate the output. Note: you missed an error at line 67.",pending,pending
cooka,Adam Cook,100,Nicely done,100,Nicely done; a good concern about getting a consensus vote when altering an organism’s genetics.,92,"Nicely done; You are correct, logical bugs can be only be found when you can approximate the output. Note: you missed an error at line 68.",pending,pending
cookc,Christopher Cook,100,Nicely done,100,Nicely done; Good Idea about finding ways to avoid lymes in humans while to avoiding problems associated with mice genetics.,92,"Nicely done; You are correct, logical bugs can be only be found when you can approximate the output.

hewittk,Kiley Hewitt,100,Nicely done,100,"Nicely done; Interesting idea about restricting access to genetic data (question 1) and the methods of editing genomes. Many people already know how to edit genomes, but education needs to be in place about when to use this technology.",100,"Nicely done; You are correct, logical bugs can be only be found when you can approximate the output.",pending,pending
kahesayn,Natnael Kahesay,100,Nicely done,100,Nicely done; a good concern about altering animal genetics without communication,100,"Nicely done; You are correct, logical bugs can be only be found when you can approximate the output.",pending,pending
koscinskic,Caden Koscinski,100,Nicely done,100,Nicely done; a good concern about having consent from subjects when performing research.,100,"Nicely done; You are correct, logical bugs can be only be found when you can approximate the output.",pending,pending
lordc,Cathlin Lord,100,Nicely done,95,Your code does not need the input() function to modify the input sequences. I can show you how to fix your code if you are interested and book an office hour slot or find me after class.,92,"Nicely done; You are correct, logical bugs can be only be found when you can approximate the output. Note: you missed an error at line 67.",pending,pending
luoman,Nicole Luoma,100,Nicely done,95,"Your compseq.py program seems to have a bug. Excellent insight from your reflection document. You are right, rewriting DNA from a species may not be a great idea especially when the new organism may disrupt the equilibrium in nature. ",92,"Nicely done; You are correct, logical bugs can be only be found when you can approximate the output. Note: you missed an error at line 71.",pending,pending
reibelj,Jonathan Reibel,100,Nicely done,95,Your baseCounter.py code does not count all occurrences of bases in a sequence. You could try using seq_str.count(base) to count bases. I liked your comment about how the gene editing technologies could be misused and weponized if we do not have a series of regulations to control this research.,92,"Nicely done; You are correct, logical bugs can be only be found when you can approximate the output. Note: you missed an error at line 61.",pending,pending
samuelr,Robert Samuel,100,Nicely done,100,Nicely done; Good comment about unexpected adverse side effects from gene editing if we do not watch what we are doing when altering natural evolution.,92,"Nicely done; You are correct, logical bugs can be only be found when you can approximate the output. Note: you missed an error at line 67.",pending,pending
spitalnyd,Devin Spitalny,100,Nicely done,95,"Nicely done; your base counter does not count pairs but the code is very nicely written with a good approach to a solution. Also, you comment is very relevant about not knowing how things will play out and evolve when making big changes to genomes.",92,"Nicely done; You are correct, logical bugs can be only be found when you can approximate the output. Note: you missed an error at line 67.",pending,pending
stephensonc,Christopher Stephenson,100,Nicely done,100,"Nicely done; your code looks great. Also, great comment concerning unforeseen complications that could cause harm instead of reducing Lyme-infections.",100,"Nicely done; You are correct, logical bugs can be only be found when you can approximate the output.",pending,pending
