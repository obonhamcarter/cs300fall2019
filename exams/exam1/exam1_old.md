Blurb:
Here is your exam 1 for Bioinformatics (CS300 and Bio300). This exam is closed notes and closed book; you are not allowed to run any code on any computer to answer any questions. Please have only this tab open on the browser. The exam is to be completed in Alden hall only. By the submission of your exam, you are agreeing to adhere to the honor code pledge.

Best of luck to all,
Dr. Bonham-Carter


Q1: What are the three parts that make up nucleotides in DNA?
> a: A phosphate group, a 5-carbon sugar, and nitrogenous base
b: A phosphosite group, a salt and a nutritious base
c. A prosite group, a sugar and a nucleotide grate  
d. A nucleotide group, a sugar and a nitrogen
e. None of these


Q2. What is the significance of the 5' and 3' labels on the ends of DNA?

a) The 5' and 3' are the carbon locations where the pyrimidines attach
b) The 5' is the strand to which the purines are attached
> c) The carbon on the 3' end is where the next region of the sequence will be placed.
d) The 3' end of the helix is the strand that provides protein.
e) None of these

Q3. ```file: Q3.png```
In the figure, what type of replication model is shown?
a) The Dispersive model
b) The non-conservative model
c) The conservative model
> d) The semi-conservative model


Q4. What are the three basic types of mutations in DNA?
a) frame-shifting, reading-frame shifting and point-shifting
> b) Insertions, deletions, and frameshift mutations
c) Insertions, group-ion deletions, base-polarity alterations
d) Onion inductions, nucleotide-spread-blurrings, atomic mis-joins.


Q5.
In the DNA of certain bacterial cells, it has been discovered that 16% of the nucleotides are adenines. What are the percentages of the other bases?

> a) 16% thymidine, 34% guanine, 34% cytosine
b) 34% thymidine, 34% guanine, 14% cytosine
c) 16% thymidine, 16% guanine, 34% cytosine
d) 34% thymidine, 34% guanine, 16% cytosine

Q6.
A DNA helix is composed of two strands. One strand is shown below with respect to its 3' and 5' ends. What is the complimentary strand for this sequence on the helix?
5'- AAATTTGGGC -3'

> a) 5'- TTTAAACCCG -3'
b)   3'- TTTAAACCCG -5'
c)   3'- TTTUUUGGGC -5'
d)   5'- TTTUUUGGGC -3'


Q7. In the Python3 code below, a string is shown. What is the output from the code below the string's declaration?

s_str = "ATTGATTC"
s_str.count("at")

output = ?

solution: 0

Q8. In two or three MEANINGFUL sentences, please explain the difference between an "Allele" and a "Gene."
solution: Alleles are variations of a gene.


Q9. Much of research in bioinformatics is spent on comparing genetic sequences of bases or amino acids from DNA and protein, respectively. In two or three MEANINGFUL sentences, describe how a comparison may help researchers track an outbreak of influenza sequence.

Solution: A virus strand causing influenza can be traced through a population. Researchers are able to compare the sequences of influenza between communities to determine similarities in the viruses that will suggest how the virus moved from one region to another.



Q10. In two or three MEANINGFUL sentences, please describe how horizontal gene
transfer can lead to types of bacteria which are immune to antibiotics.

Solution: A plasmid carrying genes for antibiotic resistance may be transferred from donor bacteria into other bacterial cells. The resistance may then be observed in cells which never had it before.      

Q11. Bonus Question: Your grade on this quiz cannot exceed 10 (i.e., the points from all correctly answered questions).

In two or three MEANINGFUL sentences, please explain what is meant by a "Silent Mutation." In your explanation, explain what causes these mutations  and why they are called, "mutations."

Solution: Silent mutations are mutations in DNA where an amino acid's codon is altered but the same amino acid is still produced by the modified codon. A point mutation in the DNA codons of Serine and Leucine, for example, may still allow for these amino acids to be produced.
