#### Lab 04 Steps and Questions Regarding PubMed

---


Part 1: Goto: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ and perform a search across "All Databases" for ```SREBF1``` and you should be taken to a new page regarding gene results. Note: you should now be at the address: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=SREBF1


---

#### Questions:
##### 1. What do you see?


##### 2. From this page, what is SREBF1's full name?


##### 3. What other names does is gene have?


---


Part 2: Click on the ```Orthologs``` button on this page. Note: you should now be at the address: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6720/ortholog/?scope=7776

#### Questions:
##### 4. What page are you on now; what type of information do you see?


##### 5. From the description, what chromosome does ```SREBF1``` originate?


##### 6. What are some of the other organisms in which this gene has been discovered?


---


Part 3: On the "Homo sapiens" row, find the column for "Gene" and click on the link for ```SREBF1``` to take you to the another page. Note: you should now be at the address: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6720/

#### Questions:
##### 7. What page are you on now; what type of information do you see?


##### 8. What organism does the gene of this record come from?


##### 9. From this page, what reason(s) do you have that this same gene may be found in other organisms?


---


Part 4: Locate the ```Genomic regions, transcripts, and products``` field of the page. Find the gene in green labelled as "NM_001005291.3",  and click on it. After your click, two other lines (blue and red) have opened up beneath the green line.

#### Questions:

##### 10. What is the difference between the green, blue and red lines? What do these lines actually represent?


##### 11. Using a mouse-over, determine the ```Compliment locations``` of the green and blue lines. Are the green and blue lines the same length?


##### 12. Using the RNA-seq exon coverage information towards the bottom of this graphical spread, offer a reason about why the the green and blue lines may differ in length. Note, you may have to review the connotations of "exons".

Part 5: Discussed in the lab assignment, Do *et al.* performed research on the SNP ```rs11868035```. Complete a PubMed search to determine what the alternative bases are for this SNP. For this, search for this SNP to see what information that you uncover about this ```rs11868035```. Please ask questions as necessary!


##### 13. Lucky number thirteen's question:
