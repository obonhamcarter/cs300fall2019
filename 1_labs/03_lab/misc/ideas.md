# Bioinformafics lab 3: translation

## Deliverables for the lab

Combine the program from this week that transcribes and translates dna with the other program that find differences between sequences.

### Steps
User enters two sequences of the same length; a wild-type sequence and one with a / some mutation(s).

#### Program properties_
- Program checks if the sequence is valid DNA containing {A,C,G,T} bases.
- Program compares the DNA for differences and reports all positions where there are differences between both entered sequences and the characters at those locations in each sequence.

Translation
- Program checks if each sequence length is divisible of 3 for the codon reading.
- Program produces RNA and Protein sequences for each sequence
- Protein sequences are compared and positions of difference in each protein sequence are reported.
