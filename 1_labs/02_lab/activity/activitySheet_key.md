Instructions: Using terms from the term bank (below), as well as other words that you find yourself, please complete the below questions.

1. In DNA, a nucleotide is made of three parts: a __phosphate__ group, a five carbon __sugar__, and a __nitogenous__ base.

2. In a single strand of DNA, the phosphate group binds to the __sugar__ of the next nucleotide.

3. The DNA of any species contains equal amounts of  __adenine__ and __thymine__ and also equal amounts of __guanine__ and __cytosine__.

4. In DNA, thymine is complementary to (or pairs with) __adenine__; cytosine is complementary to __guanine__.

5. In a strand of DNA, if the percentage of thymine is 30%, what would the percentage of cytosine in the same DNA strand be? __20%__.

6. James Watson and Francis Crick with, the help of Rosalind Franklin and others, determined that the shape of the DNA molecule was a __double helix__.

7. Pyrimidines have this many rings __one (are A's and G's)__ and purines have this number of rings __two (are T's and C's)__.

8. In DNA, purines always pairs with __pyrimidines__.

9. You are given the below sequence of DNA. Please find its complimentary strand.
s_str     = "ACTTACGCCGAT"
scomp_str = "TGAATGCGGCTA"
