Presentation Thoughts:
Students need to sign up for presentation dates during lab this week - share via google drive
Review presentation instructions with students in lab this week
May need to bump one Friday presentation to Tuesday
Ask students to come in early and put slides on front computer - cut down on time logging in/out of accounts between presentations
Ask students to provide electronic and/or hard copy of slides?
Need to create a rubric for grading
